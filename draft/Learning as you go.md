One common piece of advice i've seen across tech social media is to learn as you go... that if you want to make to something just make it and "learn as you go" i somewhat disagree with this.

here are some reasons why learniing as you go can be a bad idea

### Getting Overwhelmed

a couple of months ago in a discord server i was in, a certain individual approached us asking us how to make a certain project he wated to make. it was a rather complicated project requiring its own webhooks and backend. When we told him about the skills he needed to know he got overwhelmed and started to ask the same question again and again expecting a different answer for some reason.

the skills required to become even only a frontend developer are vast with the many frameworks, libraries standards and skills you need. many would become overwhelmed and not want make it in the end.

### Doing it Right

Programming isn't about simply doing something it's about doing something right. Scalability, Readability, Speed and Space, in addition, to the conventions in programming. Now, speed and space may not be a concern depending on the projects as computers are incredibly powerful nowadays and readability it could be argued aren't as important if your the only person doing it. but scalability is important. for example, i could create a social media site with a thousand static html files, but it wouldn't be a good idea.
