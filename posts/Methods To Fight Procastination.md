All my life i've been fighting procationation. ever since i was a child i was never forced to hand in my homework by my mom, but even though i wanted to hand in my homework, i rarely could manage to. procastination has destroyed my life, gave me severe depression and forever made me insecure of myself. Here are the methods i've found useful to help combat it

#### 5 second rule

it's fairly simple, you simply count backwards and it's said to allow your brain to start acting and stop thinking which helps against procastination

#### Pomodoro

this one's sort of a mixed bag for me. the idea is that you work for 25 mins (interchangeable) and then have a 5 min break and then work for 25 mins again and so on. the issue for me is that once you go on that break it's hard to go back to work again. i feel like for procastinators the hardest thing is to get started in the first place and switching so much between working and taking a break is challenging. i do use something similiar where iwork for about 2 hours and take a break take a break for 1 hour, but i have been facing concencration even when i'm meant to be working

#### self-reflection

it is important is to realise why you are procastinating in the first place. To solve a problem you must understand it after all. for me, i've realised that the reason i've been procastinating is because of how overwhelming the tasks i've given myself seem. i've given myself tasks and a timeframe to complete them. my mistake was that i was very outcome-oriented. that i had to complete a task by next week when in reality i can't control the results. look further, i'll try to do things for the journey and the fun of it rather than expecting a result.

#### forgiveness

in trying to fight procastination you are probably going to fail a lot. for me, that was certainly the case. that's ok, it's important at yourself rather than being angry at the present. In programming, it is commonly suggested that you spend at least 2 hours a day practising, ive failed this rule quite a few times, and because of it would end up not coding for days even a week. it would create this endless loop where you feel bad cause you didn't meet your schedule and because you feel bad you keep not meeting your schedule and thus, feel even worse and the cycle goes on forever. it's important to notice if you are in this cycle and put a end to it, remember it's not about the outcome, it's about the journey the taking the action.

#### conclusion

i hope my methods have you helped at all. to this day, i constantly stuggle with procastination and hope to overcome it someday.
