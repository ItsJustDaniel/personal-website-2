About a year ago i created my first personal website, in that site i had a blog... it wasn't a very good blog, in fact it only ever had about 3-4 posts and even the content in that was mostly gibberish. I plan on starting a new blog and this time hopefully it will be serious and fill of rich content.

### what will i be doing to help circumvent what happened last time?

I'm much better (i think) at dealing with procastination so i'm hoping that it will just come easily to me now. i've been experimenting with a lot of productivity tools and if im having difficulty with this i think i will just continue looking for ones that help me i think

### How much will you be posting?

I plan on posting at least once to twice a week.

### What will you be posting about

i will be posting about mostly software. technologies, tutorials, advice, opinions on existing framework and up and comming ones and where i think this industry is at and where it's heading. i also think that posting about philosophy would be cool.

### Why Should I Care?

You shouldn't. this will just another blog in the never ending sea of blogs, i only do this to help improve my articulating skills and also maybe help get myself a job in the future. I always had a problem of expressing myself properly and i hope that this will improve that
