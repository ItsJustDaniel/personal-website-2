We live in the age of data. According to Forbes, 90% of the world's data was generated in the last two years. now this is questionable because it's been repeated by articles for quite a few years now, but that aside, we are overwhelmed with data and it can be hard to comprehend the amount of information that we're receiving, that's where data visualisation comes in. data visualisation allows us to see and comprehend data. it allows us to see the stories that can be told through data.

For example, it can rather hard to comprehend the million to billion gap as its no more than the zeroes to us. but take this popular data visualisation of it and you can see just how massive the difference is https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/

I started learning data visualisation through the freecodecamp curriculum and here are some of the cool things i've learn from it

### function chaining

d3 uses function chaining for to render, this is a little different from what i've expect as graphics library are mostly oop based.

### Scales

it is unlikely that you would plot data as-is as the canvas may not be able the data values. this is where scales come in.

In D3, scales are functions that take an input which is usally a number, date or category and return an output to a coordinate,colour length or radius to map onto a canvas.
