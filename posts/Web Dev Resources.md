"Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is." – Isaac Asimov

As a self-taught developer, one of the bigger challenges– is to know which resources are good. it can be rather hard to find good resources simply because of just how many there are on the internet. Not all resources are built the same. Some use gamification, some explain things and some teach things that others simply dont. This is a list of the resources that i've used and found to be useful

this is opposed to colleges and bootcamps that do have focus, where you are and where you can go

You should know that even though resources here are quite good, only you can master these through practice. Teachers and resources at best, can only teach core concepts. It is up to you to understand the technicalities and master it. I suggest learning through this way: Learn concept -> do a project based on it to iterate over the things you have learnt etc.

Most of how I learnt my fundamentals is through the freecodecamp curriculum. I will not be linking that because it was incredibly boring, but I might be linking snippets here and there. The one good thing about fcc is that at the end of the courses they give you sort of assignments that you can do and it contains test suites so you constantly check if you’re doing it right or not.

## General

Roadmap - https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap - try not to get overwhelmed, I don’t even know half the stuff on there, but it’s good at providing direction in that you know where you are and where you can go from there.

The Internet - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work - the two youtube videos seen at the top of the site are pretty good too.

Basic backend knowledge - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side

## CSS

#### Flex/Grid

to learn:

https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/

#### Responsiveness

https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts

#### Design

though we may not be web designers, every web developer should at least know the fundamentals of web design.

https://scrimba.com/g/gdesign - teaches the fundalmental of design

#### Practice

perhaps the most important. you can practice however way you want, but these are some ways you could do it.

https://www.frontendpractice.com/ - try and recreate the sites shown here

#### Youtubers/content creators

Youtubers are great because they will always do videos on the recent stuff like what is being added/updated with the language they are using, also their consistency of their content is quite good.

Kevin Powell – the master of CSS, if any of the resources on CSS listed here contradict with the information given by Kevin Powel, always believe Kevin
https://www.youtube.com/user/KepowOb

Design course – Does content of design-related stuff
https://www.youtube.com/user/DesignCourse

Adrian Twarog – does design/web dev stuff + he’s Australian Pog
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvM5YYWwfLwpcQgbRr68JLQ

Chris Coyier – does incredibly in-depth blogs on css stuff
https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyier/

Adam Argyle – works at google chrome, incredibly skilled and experienced, one of the few people who dives deep in the behind-the-scenes of css (and its programmatic nature)
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBGr3ZMcV5jke40_Wrv3fNA

## JS

#### Function Programming

Learn the functional paradigm and all its features
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUiFMZr7vk&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84 – it’s a little old, even for when I was learning it but, mpj is such a good teacher that I couldn’t resist.
Otherwise you can just search up any functional js video
Algorithms/Basic Scripting – Practice your algorithms
Basic scripting -
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/

Intermediate Scripting (note: These ones you will find tough) - https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/sum-all-numbers-in-a-range

Algorithm sites are also good to practice
https://www.codewars.com/
https://leetcode.com/
https://www.codingame.com/start

#### Advanced

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv_5Zv5c-Ts&t=3642s – goes in-depth into javascript and how its made, and what happens behind the scenes
you might want to consider buying the Udemy course after watching the video.
https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-javascript/
I have the course and I might gift it away honestly when i'm done with
Object Oriented Programming
Even though it’s probably not going to be used in the frontend it's still worth knowing if you want to be a backend dev, also javascript was originally built as an OOP language. I recall no special resources other than the youtube/Udemy course linked above.
React
https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html - docs
I have a react/redux course that I am not really doing. I can give it to you for free if you want, But any react tutorial should be good enough.

#### Practice

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/ - assignments from freecodecamp

##### Advanced React

React hooks and Context – just search up
https://overreacted.io/ - Dan Abramov is one of the engineers who made React, he has been generous enough to uncover its secrets, best practices, he also does general blogs on all things coding.

##### Good Dan Blogs
